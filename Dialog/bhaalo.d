Fall to your knees—you can do no other! I am within you. I am your essence.

You may as well ask to live without blood or deny you breathe air! I am of you and within you; I am what you should have been!

You were not born to replace; you are fuel for the return! I shall act as you were born to! You will surrender to the instinct! To the blood!

What do I want?! Your life, your soul, your body! I am the instinct that will fuel the father! I am the blood!

You cannot run from yourself; you cannot defeat yourself! I am the blood! I am the instinct!

I am your instinct, yet you deny me?! Fight me within your own mind?! I should devour you! How do you stand?!

I sense your soul... It has taken form to guide from within! You are strange among your kin! 

But it... it is weak and will not help again! You are empty inside! There is nothing within but the instinct! 

But it... it is weak and will not help again! You are empty inside! There is nothing within... but the instinct!



 You cannot run from yourself

I am your instinct, yet you deny me?

you are fuel for the return!
