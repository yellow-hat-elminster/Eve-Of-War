== bk9Jenor ~I think you can do better.~
== bk9NerJe  ~OHH COME ON. It's not like I'm *trying* to tear a hole in the Weave. Besides, I'm a BETTER mage than you. What do you even know?~
== bk9Jenor ~What knowledge in the arcane that I may lack I have made up for in other areas. Studying history, the art of fighting, the teachings of Azuth. Open your mind to new ideas Neera. Wild magic does not have to be the only way you cast spells. I can teach you otherwise.~

== bk9Jenor ~Tis is a long story. I doubt you want to hear all of it.~
== bk9NerJe ~Fine then, give me the short version.~
== bk9Jenor  ~Very well. I grew up in the countryside near the City of Berdusk. My family owns a small parcel of land out that way, and for many years I helped them tend to the harvests and livestock. Eventually, I decided to leave the farm and travel to the city for employment.~
= ~My efforts to secure employment were unsuccessful. However, as I struggled in the city I grew close to many of its churches - one of which was a temple of Azuth. The priests there were kind, offering me food and shelter. The priesthood taught me of Azuth and in the ways of magic. A handful of the temples monks even sought fit to teach me the ways of combat.~
== bk9NerJe ~Huh, living day after day surrounded by priests and monks. Certainly explains why you aren't the life of the party.~
